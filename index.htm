		<article id="art1"> One of the things I enjoy doing is writing. I build story archs and characters with the company of others but mainly myself. I enjoy world-building and character building to create a story that is enjoying to read and partake in. I take a lot of inspiration from games such as Overwatch, NieR Automata, and in general games that have a lot of story and plot. Writing allows me to flesh out my creativity and is a stress reliever of sorts. It goes hand in hand with my love for drawing, allowing me to draw the characters that I write about. It also allows me to visually understand and see the characters. .</article>

		<article> I was first introduced to writing when I was much younger, probably around middle school. This was the time when I was very much into reading and writing and loved watching cartoons and playing video games. I thought that I loved it so much, why not include myself in on the fun. I wrote with a lot of my friends, and still to this day we have a story written, collected of events for over 4 years. </article></section>
